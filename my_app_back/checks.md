# Squads

1. [SQUAD-02] Back Posture:

- The torso should remain relatively upright.
- The back shouldn’t lean excessively forward (which increases spinal and knee stress).
- Ideally, the line from shoulder to hip forms a moderate angle with the vertical axis.

2. [SQUAD-03] Squad depth:

The hip joint dropping at least to the same level as the knee joint (i.e., "parallel") or below it ("deep squat").

3. [SQUAD-04] Head alignment:

The ear should remain roughly aligned vertically with the shoulder or hip, depending on how upright the torso is.

# Pull-Ups

1. [PULLUP-01] Full Range of Motion (ROM)

- The movement should begin from a dead hang with nearly full elbow extension.
- The chin must reach above the bar level at the top of the movement.
- Elbow angle should transition from ~170–180° (bottom) to ~60° or less (top).

2. [PULLUP-03] Body Control (No Kipping or Swinging)

- The torso should remain relatively vertical and stable throughout the movement.
- Excessive swinging of the hips or legs indicates lack of control or momentum-based lifting (kipping).
- Look for horizontal displacement of hips and/or ankles.

3. [PULLUP-04] Shoulder Engagement

- The shoulders should remain depressed and retracted, not elevated toward the ears.
- A consistent distance between the shoulders and ears indicates scapular control.
- Avoid passive hanging or shrugging at the bottom position.

4. [PULLUP-05] Feet Crossed for Stability

- The feet should be crossed or at least remain close together to reduce lower body swing.
- Excessive distance between ankles horizontally (or vertically if one leg hangs lower) suggests poor lower-body control.
