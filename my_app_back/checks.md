# Squads

1. [SQUAD-02] Back Posture:

- The torso should remain relatively upright.
- The back shouldnâ€™t lean excessively forward (which increases spinal and knee stress).
- Ideally, the line from shoulder to hip forms a moderate angle with the vertical axis.

3. [SQUAD-04] Head alignment:

The ear should remain roughly aligned vertically with the shoulder or hip, depending on how upright the torso is.
